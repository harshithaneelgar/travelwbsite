            <h2><strong>Explore Beautiful Destinations</strong></h2>
            <p>Discover amazing tourist places around the world.
                Travelling is an amazing way to learn a lot of things in life.
                <br> A lot of people around the world travel every year to many places.<br>
                 Moreover, it is important to travel to humans.<br>
                  Some travel to learn more while some travel to take a break from their life. <br>
                  No matter the reason, travelling opens a big door for us to explore the world<br>
                   beyond our imagination and indulge in many things. 
            </p>
            <p><h2><strong>Why Do We Travel?</strong></h2><br>
                There are a lot of reasons to travel. <br>
                Some people travel for fun while some do it for education purposes.<br>
                Similarly, others have business reasons to travel.<br>
                 In order to travel, one must first get an idea of their financial situation and then proceed.<br>
                
                Understanding your own reality helps people make good travel decisions. <br>
                If people gave enough opportunities to travel, they set out on the journey.<br>
                 People going on educational tours get a first-hand experience of everything theyâ€™ve read in the text.<br>
                
                Similarly, people who travel for fun get to experience and indulge in refreshing things which may serve as a stress reducer in their lives.<br>
                 The culture, architecture, cuisine <br>and more of the place can open our mind to new things.</p>
                 <p><h2><strong>The Benefits of Travelling</strong></h2>
                    There are numerous benefits to travelling if we think about it.<br>
                     The first one being, we get to meet new people.<br>
                      When you meet new people, you get the opportunity to make new friends. <br>
                      It may be a fellow traveller or the local you asked for directions.<br>
                    
                    Moreover, new age technology has made it easier to keep in touch with them.<br>
                     Thus, it offers not only a great way to understand human nature but also explore new places with those friends to make your trip easy.<br>
                                         
                    Similar to this benefit, travelling makes it easier to understand people.<br>
                     You will learn how other people eat, speak, live and more. When you get out of your comfort zone,<br>
                      you will become more sensitive towards other cultures and the people.<br>
                    
                    Another important factor which we learn when we travel is learning new skills.<br>
                     When you go to hilly areas, you will most likely trek and thus, trekking will be a new skill added to your list.<br>
                    
                    Similarly, scuba diving or more can also be learned while travelling.<br>
                    A very important thing which travelling teaches us is to enjoy nature.<br> It helps us appreciate the true beauty of the earth.</p>
